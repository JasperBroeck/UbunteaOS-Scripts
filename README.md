## Install
- install Ubuntu 23.04
   - I recommend to choose for a minimal install
   - I will also recommend to NOT install additional driver
   - INSTALL THE additional formats and things like that
- Download the latest-release.zip
   - Download the zip from github
   - Unpack the zip file
- Install the script
   - Run the script, you can do this with the following command
   - ```bash
      chmod +x script.sh
      #makes the script installable

      ./script.sh
      #installs the script
      ```
- **Note**: if you install the script this way, it is possible you need to press Y and Enter sometimes, just follow the terminal instructions.
- **Note**: when you install or run the script it is possible that some things are installed but not yet enabled, you can do all of this in the settings, gnome tweaks or gnome extensions application.
